        <h1> Concerts of a Lifetime</h1>
        <p> Welcome, this is my personal blog. I talk about all my concerts,
            that throughout the years I went to. I have a big passion for concerts,
            that is why I went to a lot of them. Some were good, some were not so great.
            But I have loved all of them. </p>
        <p> I wish you a lot of reading pleasure and I hope you'll enjoy this just as
            much as I enjoyed experiencing the concerts and making this website! </p>

                <h3> Dua Lipa </h3>
                <p>A very famous artist, but I didn't really know who she was. Although I went to her concert, still, it
                    was an insane experience. </p>

                <h3>Blackbear</h3>
                <P>He is famous for his songs like iDFC and Hot summer, but how is he live? Is he just as good as we
                    think he
                    is? </P>

                <h3>Tame Impala</h3>
                <P>What is something he can't do? He writes, makes music and can sing. And what about his concerts? Did
                    it really brought tears in my eyes? Read more </p>
